# Vulnerability Report

This report summarizes potential security weaknesses for the discovered wireless networks, based solely on passive information (SSID, encryption, signal, and basic parameters).  
No intrusive or active testing was performed.

---

## General Observations

- All detected networks use **WPA2** or **WPA3** – no Open or WEP networks were discovered.
- Most networks appear to be **home / small office routers** (Zentec, generic SSIDs, mobile hotspots).
- One **enterprise network (KBTU)** spans many BSSIDs and channels, indicating a campus-style deployment.
- Multiple Zentec SSIDs share a clear **vendor pattern**, exposing the router brand/model family.

## Per-Network Vulnerability Overview

### 1. (hidden) — WPA3-Personal
- SSID broadcast: hidden SSID (not shown in the scan output).
- Encryption: WPA3-Personal (CCMP).
- Risk factors:
  - Hidden SSID provides only “security through obscurity”.
  - Still depends on a strong, unique passphrase.
- Overall risk: **Low**.

### 2. KBTU — WPA2-Enterprise
- Multiple BSSIDs and channels (2.4 GHz and 5 GHz), typical for a managed enterprise Wi‑Fi.
- Encryption: WPA2-Enterprise (CCMP).
- Observed channel utilization for some APs is relatively high (up to ~78%), indicating:
  - Potential congestion and performance issues.
- Risk factors:
  - Misconfiguration or weak RADIUS policies would be more critical than the Wi‑Fi encryption itself.
- Overall risk: **Low**, assuming proper 802.1X and certificate management.

### 3. Zentec Z031 80646F3563BCd31 (and other Zentec SSIDs)
- SSID pattern clearly shows vendor (“Zentec Z031 …”).
- Encryption: WPA2-Personal.
- Risk factors:
  - Default‑looking SSID may indicate that default settings (including weak/default passwords) were not changed.
  - Attackers can quickly determine router model, then look up known vulnerabilities or default credentials.
- Overall risk: **Medium**.

### 4. iPhone — WPA3-Personal
- Likely a personal hotspot.
- Encryption: WPA3-Personal.
- Risk factors:
  - Hotspot passwords are often short or reused.
  - Device may be turned on in public places, increasing exposure.
- Overall risk: **Low to Medium** (depends on password).

### 5. Ars — WPA2-Personal
- Appears to be a home/office network on 5 GHz.
- WPA2-PSK is in use.
- Risk factors:
  - PSK could be brute-forced offline if a handshake is captured.
  - No visible enterprise or certificate-based auth.
- Overall risk: **Medium**.

### 6. Galaxy S21 FE 5G 7E8E / iPhone Yermakhan Kasymzhomart
- Both look like **mobile hotspots**.
- Encryption: WPA2-Personal.
- Risk factors:
  - Often used with simple passwords (phone numbers, names, etc.).
  - May be enabled in crowded environments (campus, cafes).
- Overall risk: **Medium**.

### 7. ABC / Karuka / WPA2-Personal / (1)
- Custom or generic SSIDs; all on WPA2-Personal.
- Risk factors:
  - Security entirely depends on passphrase complexity and router configuration.
- Overall risk: **Medium**.

## Duplicate SSIDs and Rogue AP Indicators

- The **KBTU** SSID appears across many BSSIDs on different channels and bands:
  - This is consistent with a **legitimate enterprise deployment** (multiple APs under one SSID).
  - No suspicious duplicate SSIDs were observed that clearly indicate a rogue AP.
- Zentec SSIDs are all different strings, so no obvious rogue clones are visible.

---

## Environment Risk Summary

- **Encryption Layer:** Modern (WPA2/WPA3), no legacy Open/WEP networks.
- **Main Weakness:** Heavy reliance on **WPA2-Personal (PSK)**, which is only as strong as the password chosen by users.
- **Enterprise Presence:** One WPA2-Enterprise network (KBTU) is a strong positive sign, assuming correct 802.1X configuration.
